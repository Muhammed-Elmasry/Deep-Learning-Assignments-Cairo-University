This notebook demonstrates how to use neural networks for music generation. We experiment with various models to create new music pieces.

## 4. Autoencoders

**Notebook:** `A4_Autoencoders.ipynb`

Here, we explore autoencoders, a type of neural network used for unsupervised learning. The notebook covers different types of autoencoders and their applications.

## 5. UNet Model

**Notebook:** `A5_1_Unet.ipynb`

This notebook focuses on the UNet model, widely used for image segmentation tasks. We go through the architecture and implementation of UNet.

## 6. Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)

**Notebook:** `A5_2_CNN.ipynb`

We delve into Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) in this notebook. CNNs are essential for image processing and computer vision tasks.

## 7. Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs)

**Notebook:** `A6_GANs.ipynb`

This notebook introduces Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), a class of models used for generating synthetic data. We explore the architecture and training of GANs.

## 8. Deep Bayesian Variational Autoencoder (DBVAE)

**Notebook:** `A7_DBVAE.ipynb`

Here, we discuss the Deep Bayesian Variational Autoencoder (DBVAE), which combines variational inference with deep learning for generative modeling.

## 9. Transfer Learning

**Notebook:** `A8_Transfer_Learning.ipynb`

This notebook covers transfer learning, a technique where a pre-trained model is fine-tuned on a new task. Transfer learning is useful for leveraging existing models to solve new problems efficiently.
